# Introduction to eBPLS #

_**eBPLS**_ or electronic Business Permit and Licensing System is a software product and web application that enables Local Government Units (LGUs) to process business applications electronically. This system standardizes the business process flow and will provide faster turnover time in the processing. The often tedious manual processes that require much applicant follow-ups are replaced by a system that enables applications, queries on approval status, as well as remaining tax dues. It also supports Community Tax Certificate (CTC) processing which every LGU requires.

Processing of other types of permits (Fishery, Motorized, Occupational, and Peddlers) is also included in the system but as of May 2008 not completed, enabled nor tested.

The collections on business permits and licenses, being the primary source of income of LGUs, lay the foundation from which the plans and programs of a city or municipality are funded.
